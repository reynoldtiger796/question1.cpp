/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost 
and its markup percentage. It should then display the item's retail 
price. For example:
    a.	If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup 
        percentage is 100 percent, then the item's retail price 
        is $10.00.
    b.	If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup 
        percentage is 50 percent, then the item's retail price is $7.50.

The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives 
the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns 
the retail price of the item.
