/*
2.	The distance a vehicle travel can be calculated as follows:
    Distance = speed * time
    For example, if a train travel 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, 
    the distance traveled is 120 miles.
    Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle 
    (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. 
    It should then use a loop to display the total distance traveled 
    at the end of each hour of that time period. Here is an example of 
    the output:
